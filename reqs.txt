Min Models:
- Naive CBOW
- CBOW + NLP (post-tagging, stop words etc)
- RNN

Top1, Top5

Training split already set up
- Don't use metadata for training algo

use the dialog & caption for image retrieval,
metadata only for qualitative analysis (informs "why?")

Loss Fn: Cross Entropy
- Fix Text input, vary 1 image per predicted
    - one output per image
    - softmax over outputs
    - cross entropy based on the one hot vector (target img id)

Loss Fn: Regression
Text input -> MLP -> ResNet Features
    - MSE Loss
Distance metric as performance metric: L2
    - Try other distance norms <- nice to include in qualitative analysis

Write own pytorch dataloader
